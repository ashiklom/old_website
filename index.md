# Welcome!
My name is Alexey Shiklomanov. I am a Ph.D. Geography student at the
[Boston University Department of Earth and Environment](http://www.bu.edu/earth),
advised by [Michael Dietze](http://people.bu.edu/dietze). Our lab is broadly
interested in improving ecological forecasts, and we approach this problem
through a variety of methods, including field work on forest demography,
dynamic vegetation models, and remote sensing.

My own research interests are in bridging the gap between the remote
sensing and ecological communities. In particular, I am interested in
developing methods to assimilate remote sensing observations into
ecosystem models via radiative transfer models (RTMs). The tools I am
developing are aimed at facilitating the use of radiative transfer models
for simulating reflectance from different surfaces, as well as for
efficient Bayesian inversion of these models.

Most of this work is housed in the
[rtm](www.github.com/ashiklom/pecan/modules/rtm) module within the
[PEcAn](www.pecanproject.org) ecoinformatics toolbox.
