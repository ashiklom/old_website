<h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>
<p>My name is Alexey Shiklomanov. I am a Ph.D. Geography student at the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/earth">Boston University Department of Earth and Environment</a>, advised by <a href="http://people.bu.edu/dietze">Michael Dietze</a>. Our lab is broadly interested in improving ecological forecasts, and we approach this problem through a variety of methods, including field work on forest demography, dynamic vegetation models, and remote sensing.</p>
<p>My own research interests are in bridging the gap between the remote sensing and ecological communities. In particular, I am interested in developing methods to assimilate remote sensing observations into ecosystem models via radiative transfer models (RTMs). The tools I am developing are aimed at facilitating the use of radiative transfer models for simulating reflectance from different surfaces, as well as for efficient Bayesian inversion of these models.</p>
<p>Most of this work is housed in the <a href="www.github.com/ashiklom/pecan/modules/rtm">rtm</a> module within the <a href="www.pecanproject.org">PEcAn</a> ecoinformatics toolbox.</p>
